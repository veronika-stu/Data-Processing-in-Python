    "Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, \n",
    "compares each pair of adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. \n",
    "The process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start at the beginning** of the list.\n",
    "2. **Compare the first two elements**. If the first is greater than the second, swap them.\n",
    "3. **Move to the next pair** of elements, repeat the comparison and swap if necessary.\n",
    "4. Continue this process for each pair of adjacent elements until the end of the list.\n",
    "5. After each pass, the largest unsorted element is correctly placed at the end.\n",
    "6. **Repeat** these steps for the remaining list (excluding the last sorted elements).\n",
    "7. The sorting is complete when a pass requires no swaps.\n",

    "- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$, as it only requires a small, constant amount of additional space.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step eliminates **half of the remaining possibilities**, drastically reducing the number of comparisons.\n",
